#MatScript Sim
An LED Dot Matrix Simulator written in javascript

After building LED matrices for long, I decided to build a simulation that can be included on a web page and adjusted as per the requirements. The result is the MatScript Sim written in pure Javascript. To emulate RGB colors, randomization has been included so that different semi-random colors can be chosen for both the background and the foreground.

Although all the variables are hardcoded for now, the final version will be adjustable and customizable as per the moments needs. Also, an API will be created to interact with this engine so as to make it flexibly useable for intergration with other apps easily.

Attached a test webpage utilizing this small simulation engine.
