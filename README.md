#MatScript Sim
An LED Dot Matrix Simulator written in javascript

After building LED matrices for long, I decided to build a simulation that can be included on a web page and adjusted as per the requirements. The result is the MatScript Sim written in pure Javascript. To emulate RGB colors, randomization has been included so that different semi-random colors can be chosen for both the background and the foreground.

Attached a test webpage utilizing this small simulation engine.
