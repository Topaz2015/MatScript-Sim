#MatScript Sim
An LED Dot Matrix Simulator written in javascript
As the name suggests, his is not Marquee, its a dot matrix simulator.
After working with physical LED matrices for long, I decided to build a simulation for my javascript training. 

The result is the MatScript Sim written in pure Javascript. To emulate RGB colors, randomization has been included so that different semi-random colors can be chosen for both the background and the foreground.

Attached a test webpage utilizing this small simulation engine.
